# Yama

We are a team passionate about creating a perfect messenger. We decided to call it Yama, which stands for Yet Another Messaging App.

Fun piece of trivia: it also means 'pothole' in Russian and Ukrainian, and 'mountain' in Japanese.

## What we strive for

We strive to grab everything we love and value from various sources, be it Telegram, Facebook, Discord or something else, and leave behind the parts we hate.

## Status of the project

It is in such an early alpha version that we decided to keep the project private, for now. We definitely intend to open-source it later.
